# A* Pathfinding Algorithm Visualisation

This program visualizes the *A\* pathfinding algorithm*. The algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two points on a 2D grid. The user can create a maze on the grid and set the start and end points. The program then runs the A* algorithm and shows the shortest path between the two points.

## :warning: Prerequisites

* Must have `git` installed.
* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Installation

To use this program, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository:
```https://github.com/i-christian/A-star-Pathfinding-Algorithm-Visualisation```

* [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31010/) - The python version used.

* Install the required dependencies using pip:
```pip install pygame```


## Usage :running:

1. Run the program:
```python3 main.py```
2. Draw walls on the grid by left-clicking and dragging the mouse. To remove a wall, right-click on it.
3. Set the start and end points by left-clicking on the cells.
4. Press the ***space key*** <kbd>space</kbd> to run the algorithm.
5. Press the ***c key*** <kbd>c</kbd> to clear the grid.
